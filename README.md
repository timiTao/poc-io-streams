# [PoC] Request and Response based on streams

After a discussion with a friend, I decided to try to implement a small project to cover the Requests & Response Http project with additional requirements.
The aim is to be aware of concepts, pros & cons, and limitations to drive projects with correct architecture principles or learn from misunderstandings.

### General goals
* deeper understand reactive architecture
* better understanding of Kafka & environment
* try to find solutions for problems in that process

### Initial planned solutions 
* try to implement reactiveness with [Reactive manifesto](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
  * **scalable**
      * I assume there is infinity number of producers & consumers
      * using consumer groups
  * **message-drive**
    * based on Kafka
      * using topics with partitions
      * aim for `exactly one processing`
      * guaranty of atomic processing events
          * consider Outbox pattern
  * **independence/autonomy** of consumers 
    * consider sharing/local data per node for optimization

### Development tools
* using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* using [AKHQ](https://github.com/tchiotludo/akhq) for monitoring kafka

## [ADR](doc/adr/)

For future retrospective perspective, I would like to full records my problems, perspectives and solutions.
